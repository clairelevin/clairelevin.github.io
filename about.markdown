I am a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Florida double majoring in physics and computer science.

I am studying cybersecurity with a primary focus on reverse engineering and malware analysis. In spring 2022, I took Malware Reverse Engineering at UF. This course used the book *Practical Malware Analysis* by Sikorski and Honig, as well as several real malware samples. I sometimes CTF with DiceGang and Kernel Sanders, and I have also completed Flare-On [9](/flareon/2022/11/12/flare8-backdoor.html) and [10](/flareon/2023/11/18/over_the_rainbow.html). 

I have also taken an in-depth look at several different forms of malware, with a particular focus on ransomware. I've been making an effort to understand the underlying cryptographic algorithms that commonly appear in ransomware; for example, my [analysis](/malware/2023/03/18/teslacrypt.html) of TeslaCrypt introduced me to [elliptic curve cryptography](/malware/2023/03/18/ecc.html).

I've also studied quantum computing both in my coursework and through some independent study, and I'm especially interested in the implications that quantum algorithms will have for cryptography.
