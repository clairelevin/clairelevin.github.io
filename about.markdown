I am a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Florida double majoring in physics and computer science. I'm planning a career in reverse engineering or quantum computing.

I am studying cybersecurity with a primary focus on reverse engineering and malware analysis. In spring 2022, I took Malware Reverse Engineering at UF. This course used the book *Practical Malware Analysis* by Sikorski and Honig, as well as several real malware samples. Currently, I am a CTF player with DiceGang and Kernel Sanders, and I have also solved individual challenges such as Flare-On 9. Over the past few months, I have also taken an in-depth look at several different forms of malware, with a particular focus on ransomware.

I'm also studying quantum computing, and I'm especially interested in the implications that quantum algorithms will have for cryptography. I'm currently taking a quantum computing course where I'm learning to implement quantum algorithms using Qiskit.
