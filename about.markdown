I'm a malware analyst with a focus on ransomware. I'm interested in understanding the cryptographic algorithms that commonly appear in ransomware, and ideally, finding vulnerabilities in the implementations of those algortihms. As an example, take a look at my [analysis](/malware/2023/03/18/teslacrypt.html) of TeslaCrypt, and the [overview](/malware/2023/03/18/ecc.html) of elliptic curve cryptography that I wrote to go along with it.

I also play CTFs once in a while, currently with DiceGang and formerly with Kernel Sanders. I've especially enjoyed doing Flare-On, and have completed Flare-On [9](/flareon/2022/11/12/flare8-backdoor.html) and [10](/flareon/2023/11/18/over_the_rainbow.html). 

Currently, I'm trying to branch out a little and learn some new skills like vulnerability research and exploit development. I'm also interested in quantum computing and how it will affect cryptography. Hopefully, I'll be able to post a few writeups on those subjects as I learn more.

If you have any questions about the writeups I've posted here, feel free to reach out to me on [Mastodon](https://haunted.computer/@amnesia).
