I am a third-year undergraduate at the University of Florida double majoring in physics and computer science. I'm planning a career in reverse engineering or quantum computing, and I'm looking for an internship for summer 2023.

I am studying cybersecurity with a primary focus on reverse engineering and malware analysis. In spring 2022, I took Malware Reverse Engineering at UF. This course used the book *Practical Malware Analysis* by Sikorski and Honig, as well as several real malware samples. I'm also an active CTF player with DiceGang and Kernel Sanders. This year, I've participated in as many CTFs as I could. I also work on individual challenges, including completing Flare-On 9.

I'm also studying quantum computing, and I'm especially interested in its implications for cryptography. I'm currently taking a quantum computing course where I'm learning to implement quantum algorithms using Qiskit.
